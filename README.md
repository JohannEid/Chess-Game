# Chess
Project is made up of a console part (not for playing because it really isn't fun to ) the code was pretty nice in my opinion 
not very big and gets the job done.
Second branch is graphical the one you actually want to play I changed a lot of thing about the design I had with the console
the game is playable and has the same rules as any chess game. It was a good introduction to SFML.
ps : SOATRAP is an other older account I used so some of the commits have this name
